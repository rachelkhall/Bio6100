Instructions for running code during the presentation.

1) In R-studio, you will first need to install several packages that probably are not already present in your system. Please use RStudio to install:

log4r
TeachingDemos
tidyverse
pracma
ggmosaic

These only need to be installed one time, before you start the session. If you have not installed a package before:

a) find the "Packages" tab in Rstudio. 
b) click on the "Install" tab.
c) begin typing the name of one of the packages
d) find the package that you need in the pop-up list
e) click "Install"
f) repeat for the other 4 packages on this list


2) From the root of the project directory, open the script "SingleScript.R"

3) You are now ready to follow along with the presentation!

In this presentation, you will execute the code one line at a time, and we will discuss the results at each step. To execute a single line of code in a script, do the following:

4) Put your cursor at the start of the line of code you are about to run.
5) Hold down the <Control> or <Command> key
6) While holding, hit the <Enter> or <Return> key once
7) Wait and watch carefully what happens

Note that the code in this particular presentation creates a number of new folders, plots, and files inside the project. This means you cannot run it a second time because the script will not over-write objects that it has already created.

If you want to experiment ahead of time with the script and functions, that is fine, but you will want a fresh version of the project set up for the start of our session.

If something goes wrong, don't panic. You cannot hurt anything on your computer or in the project. Just listen carefully to the rest of the presentation, because you will still be able to learn about the material even if you are not executing the code.
